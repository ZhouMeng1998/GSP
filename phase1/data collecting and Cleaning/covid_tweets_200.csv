Love getting COVID exposed by my idiot coworker who was feeling sick yesterday but decided to snot all over the lab instead of wearing a mask
"Hepatitis C Virus Reactivation Following COVID-19 Vaccination

“She had a reactivation of hepatitis C infection after vaccination with the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This reactivation manifested with jaundice, loss of consciousness, hepatic coma and death”"
"memorial day weekend was a dream
1. face the facts that i don't know anyone in this timezone
2. spiral and start a 1000 piece puzzle
3. get covid"
Many people I know on the left have resisted the covid hysteria, but seem blind to how badly the past two years of destructive policies have demolished credibility and goodwill for @TheDemocrats. I just don’t know how to make them see it.
When you test positive for Covid but find out your offer has been accepted on your dream home on the same day. Only living life at the extremes here.
4/15 ppl in my office (though i think it might be 5 bc one cw has been sketchy) has had COVID in the last ~3-4 weeks
Feels fitting to miss out on my last week of field work for a job that moved to in May of 2020 - due to a COVID exposure in 2022.
If a million people in America died from covid, shouldn't the housing market sell off, because there are a million empty homes?
Just got a delivery of one of my favorite perfumes. I haven’t had it since I broke my last bottle about a year ago. But today I just smell… vaguely sweet nothing? Crap. Is this a Covid thing? I hadn’t noticed any loss of smell before. Or maybe this perfume batch is weird?
I have a day off today, not because I have covid or intolerable pain or doctor appointments, but just because I can. It's nice.
One thing Covid fucked up was me missing H.E.R. because my test didn't came back in enough time
There are 27 letters in the new email handle for communicating about Covid issues at @WWU. That's more than letters in the alphabet. I'm trying not to see the implied message behind such a user-unfriendly email. . .
nice lil paid covid vacation
I've been consuming extreme levels of honey to help this covid throat
just like COVID if everyone is looking at the shootings what do you expect is going to happen... wearing a mask or wearing a firearm i guess there both the same in a sense or protection #2A
to everyone listening to me blowing my nose: it is ALLERGIES. I have taken 5 covid tests
"Got engaged.
Faience got COVID the day after.
Been sleeping on the couch with the dogs ever since.
And I’ve just been working nonstop.
I’m so worried I’m going to get this shit. 😫"
Colossalcon Walmart is what’s gonna give me covid
One week into Covid chronicles, praise God I don’t have aches, but it sure is messing with my mentality. I need all the Jesus on the forefront of my mind. Lesson learned you can have mild symptoms but it will come for your thoughts. Guard it with all your heart! Not today Satan!
"Looks like covid is gone
Happy June 2022"
So is COVID over and Monkeypox the new MSM/Government scare tactic? Or will COVID 'mutate' again and create an even less, I mean more powerful/deadly virus just in time for the midterms?
happy gay month i have acquired covid
"So lastnight i had really bad chills, stomach pain, fatigue and other systems. Thought it might be covid but the test was negative.
It's fading today but im still not yet 100%. Have been very tired all day. Think it's probably norovirus."
I've managed to successfully dodge #covid so far and up until today, anything involving the #DeppVHeardTrial
if i have covid again im just going to go lay in the road
Seems very likely that Covid finally caught up to me. My rapid test this morning was negative, but I have all the symptoms (mild, thankfully). If you were at the Chicago Open chess tournament last weekend you should get tested ASAP.
Can anyone fill me in on how Twitter post covid is? still horny as? And is nihilism still a hit, or did that go out the door with the lib party
First day of covid! Well second day considering I had the most of the fever when my test still said negative. So far I've watched 1 season of Nathan for You and Harry Potter movies 3-8 I'm thinking a rewatch of Heros next wyt
Or is it covid?😭😭😂
Starting off gay month by getting COVID 😷🤧🤒
Update: I have Covid 😭
"The inflation is being caused by the prior over-spending for ""COVID relief"".  The damage has been done.  There is no way now to reduce the inflation.  Americans just have to adjust to a lower standard of living for the next decade or so."
got my covid test done and it's negative! THANK GOD! ✈️🇰🇷 tmrw!
Gun violence just overtook Ukraine and Covid for flavor of the month. Sorry LGBTQ, you get shunned again 🌈😂🖕
When you got covid so your mom has to go to the liquor store for you
Greeting,local cluster! Playing Breath of the Wild is a meaningful routine of being happy in order to not go crazy during covid time, My human once told me a story:  Alex, who is a nurse, she  took care of global warming, and she  saved a village from the deadly virus
Before Covid and even now at some places, you can walk straight up into a hospital with no questions asked, lol they’re really not safe
intacta do covid fml 🙌🏻💪🏻
Totally random info while waiting for #AEWDynamite to start. I haven’t been feel well off and on for a long time. A lot existing symptoms/medical conditions have worsened since I had #covid back in January. Really starting to think I’ve got #LongCovid.
"VanDeRock Funeral &amp; Cremation Services has seen its business nearly triple in the last few years.
Sad to see Covid go."
To com covid ebaaa  🎉😭
I’ve been super congested, coughing sneezing, DOUBLE PINK EYE. I was so scared I had COVID.. but good news.. ITS ALLERGIES. Also@bad news.. I’m allergic to everything
Tonight Covid 19 is in love with bussy
Tested positive for Covid. Who ever praying on my downfall ya mom a hoe
I wonder if ppl still think covid killed 6 million people 😂
"I have COVID. I think I'm OK. 3 days in. 

This blows, though."
"Don’t blame President Biden for the outrageously high #gasprices

Donald Trump let COVID-19 get out of hand in 2020 which led to a lockdown, no one travelled thereby reducing gas prices

Now people are traveling again since Biden got COVID under control

Also, Putin started a war"
I know I'm asking a lot but if #AEWDynamite could make me forget I have Covid for two hours then I'd be real grateful.
missing the first Center City SIPS of the summer. fuck covid
So my sister got covid and is feeling/looks and sounds terrible. She meets criteria for Paxlovid. Her doctor says I don’t know the drug well so I don’t prescribe it ever and then prescribes Azithromycin. Are you kidding me. This is where we are still. In the Bay Area to boot.
"covid : 1 
e : 0"
"I'm so over the MSM neg stories on hospitals. This is ""living with covid"" isn't it? How about they focus on telling people to wear masks, ventilate areas, meet outside, keep distanced &amp; get vaxxed? No interventions = spread right? #CovidIsNotOver  #covid19vic"
I like how we all think that big artists doing NFTs (ex. Madonna, Doja Cat, etc.) are a big deal… when it’s really just the record labels trying to get more money “cuz COVID shut down live events”. 🥴
i’m gunna be so mad if i caught covid at that midnight t show
I think I got covid again cause ain’t no way my body aching nose running like a cheetah 😭😩 I’m never going out again. You filthy animals
I wonder how the “Covid is a hoax” people are doing?
yeah, i have long covid, i can't come into work ever
didn’t know that muscle cramps/weakness was a covid side effect, but if i even think about moving out of turn my legs seize up 😶‍🌫️ also thrown my neck out from coughing!!! which is a cute fun lil thing
You know what would be a great idea, how about we get transmission down again but hear me out instead of declaring victory early we keep doing it until Covid is just controllable flair ups instead of a raging wildfire all over the country? I know, not going to happen, too hard
Worst part of Covid for me so far (3 days in) is a tie between sleepless sweaty nights and the R.O.A.D. (Rapid Onset Adult Diarrhea)
Idk something about a Covid vaccination commercial encouraging ppl to get outside is so dark sided
IM STILL POSITIVE WITH COVID WHAGTBE FUCK
Those first like 4 weeks of COVID before it got stale was lowkey fire outside of the people dying
it’s giving COVID. it’s me. im sick
The GOP was upset that children were kept out of school due to covid.But now teachers are quitting because the GOP don’t want to keep our teachers safe &amp; pass gun safety laws.When will they do what’s right for the people instead of thinking only about how much money they can get!
Don't let Covid-19 bring you down! Instead, have a spa day.
Slight improvement in leaness. Coming back post covid siu
This is every year with all these shootings. When everyone was on lockdown because of COVID, it wasn’t an issue. SMH 🤦🏽‍♀️
another week, another shooting. it's like covid, we're all getting hit eventually.
"irony learning the firm that sold mie to another (likely bc I wouldn’t share vaxx status) mandated staff back to their office now 
1 year later- a bunch got COVID in the first two weeks.  

Yikes. 

whatevs! Freelancers go where the money is, while not returning to any office."
We had an Indian place around the corner for approximately 15 days but some scandale has occurred and “closed 2 weeks cause someone got COVID” became closed forever. Mystery malfeasance
quite frankly if my blood pee and covid don’t get me a deadline extension i dont know what will
Denial is a strong American trait. If we ignore it or don’t report it, it doesn’t exist and isn’t a problem. #massshooting #covid
Getting Covid the first day of pride is the most homophobic thing that the universe could pull on me rn
Feeling achy. Hope its not the flu, covid, monkey pox or D. All of the above
What are the odds that both principal &amp; understudy get sick during tech week? I reported to the team that I tested positive for covid. Then they posted a message that two cast members tested +. I noticed that my principal wasn't at rehearsal today and yes, he's the other + guy.
I’ve had covid for seven days and I’d really like to stay awake until the sun goes down. Maybe tomorrow.
Has anyone been hearing that the gov-provided orange box COVID tests are faulty? Frequent false negatives? 🥴
I had Covid last year for my bday i got make up for it &amp; I be 25🤕
I’m more frightened of getting shot than getting Covid.  @POTUS Executive Order NOW!
parem d ter covid
Anyone who’s interacted with me on social media in the past couple of days might want to get tested for Covid
We sure quit talking bout the COVID CORONAVIRUS suddenly, didn’t we?
This is the third Pride month since I came out in 2020 and the third I can’t safely attend because nobody cares about people who are high risk for COVID
Seething with anger right now at @RWalensky @CDCgov @POTUS Your political calculus re Covid is putting me at daily risk. I do not go to bars or eat inside at restaurants, but I work in an open office with 20 somethings who are in bars all weekend and bringing Covid to the office
How many years after the Covid scam will stores take down those stupid plastic barriers? 8? 10?
#DoFo @fordnation it's been 1,217 days or over 3 years since you got @HonDavidOnley report. Calls for strong new action on #accessibility for people w/ #disabilities. We need a real action plan. Your delays create more hardships during #COVID #AODA
guess who might have covid 😀
I would like to see the data on long covid stratified according to self-employed, small business, corporate and public sector.
The biggest thing I’ve been missing since Covid started is back and I’m LIVING
A4: Since 2016-2017, there's been something (new baby, new standards, COVID) that shook up the school year, so I'm excited that next year will be on where I can focus on refining and not building from scratch. #MCPchat
"Don’t know whether to blame age, the draining difficulty of the school year, or after-effects from covid, but this is the first time ever I haven’t had a perfect report card from my PCP after a checkup.

I’m still aware that I’m extremely lucky, but it’s weird to need follow-up."
This weird combination of lies, anarchy and christofascism the #CultRight is perpetrating on America is destabilizing the country far more than record inflation and covid.
eeee to com covid
Stuck in bed with Covid and I've run out of papers to write, so I'm pondering the important questions in life, like how much anxiety is the normal amount of anxiety?
Covid ruined my life
I just had a doctor tell me to Google stuff about Covid bc it changes daily. Mmmk
Trust me to get sick on the extra holiday (sticky sticks say I don’t have Covid &amp; neighbour’s kids are also down with a non-Covid bug)
"Why is anyone surprised that airlines are cancelling flights due to staff shortages?

Of course they are! 

Of course the staff got covid! 

Of course removing masks from airplanes during a pandemic is a horrible idea!

Disabled people have been saying this from the start."
happy pride month everyone i’ve been exposed to covid
Glad that I don’t have covid but also that just means that I’m just mystery sick… hate it here what is going onnn
"I continue to just be so disenfranchised with society, given that our answer to parents over two years into a pandemic is ""just send your unvaccinated babies to daycare despite the rising cases and the unknown long term effects of COVID as a virus."""
Mano fuck COVID #infected
Getting my positive Covid test result on the first day of Pride has got to be some form of biphobia, right?
Making a summer bucket list and a summer playlist so I feel less sad about having my first week of my summer being ruined by covid 😭😭
can’t smash with covid bahahHa
Who tf gets COVID 3 times like this shit is just wild AF yo
Pfizer $PFE just released a Covid-19 vaccine for kids aged 6 months to 4 years old, lining up its coffers with vax revenues $NVAX $JNJ $MRNA
Hey y’all I’m sorry Covid is kicking my butt today, I’ll try to stream tomorrow love y’all ❤️💛💙
I beat Covid's spiky pimple ass. And I'm with Johnny.
Remember the same party that didn't care people were dying of covid are the same people that don't care about mass shootings
Oh my god, do the COVID coughing fits ever stop?
"Covid ✔️
Pandemic ✔️
Depp vs Heard ✔️
NOW GET BACK TO WORK!!!"
"We must give people their jobs back who were sacked because of their COViD vaccination status. 

The mandates must end now. 

Too many industries are in crisis. 
Too many people have had their careers and livelihoods put on ice. 

We cannot let this continue."
i dont think canada could have fucked up their covid response any harder than they did and it still infuriates me to think about. we're STILL fucking it up.
Yes where all this evidence that not only did the police Commissioner used to mandate but all the employers of whom sack their workers for not getting vaccinated hmmm I see a lot court actions in the near future all I can say this serves you right going for the covid cash cow
Why i cldnt have covid and just b home fine? I need to be taking adv of this home time. But alas im bed stricken
Not even tryna be funny but it’s like bullets saw the amount of bodies that Covid claimed and got jealous.
"Four Horsemen of Apocalypse:
I see war with Russia &amp; Ukraine as well as others around the globe. I see pestilence &amp; death with Covid-19 &amp; other afflictions worldwide. Who seems others and in what?"
Covid was just one big game of hidden in plain sight
"I’m a Scorpio and I didn’t get COVID for two years.

So Astrology prevents COVID, but it only stops the spread entirely if everyone is a Scorpio."
Last week I had a slight fever which I informed my coach of since I can't come to work. So the clinic advised me to have my 7 days quarantined even though we're on covid alert level 1. And today would have my clearance and fit to work. 🙏
"Thought my chest had escaped this time. It was waiting for DAY4.

#covid"
I’m upstate for a wedding and half of the guests can’t go because they have COVID but yeah go off don’t wear a mask at hannaford
I just don't know how you redeem a society so okay with so much death as long as few corporations make a profit. Mass shootings. Covid. Healthcare. This isn't sustainable. This isn't a status quo worth leaving fundamentally unchanged.
Not alot of my friends actually know that I was born, raised and educated in Canada. I accepted a position in the US after receiving a few offers. I have dual citizenships and the only thing missing is a clean covid test within 96 hours. In case you missed me 1/2
"Is there a non-COVID virus ripping through the Philly area right now?  Got sick last weekend and have been on my ass for 4 days now but tested neg for COVID twice in that span. Congestion, cough, fever, exhaustion. 

Whatever it is, it sucks."
Why is it that ever drug commercial list all the side effects but when you see a covid shot/ treatment pill they list no side effects? I think they are hiding the truth
So much for protecting ourselves from Covid …. Now we have to protect ourselves from shooters showing up at random places.
fuck me....i think i caught covid from my dad 💀
This marg ain’t tastin right 😞 shoutout Covid
i been so bored in the crib covid sucks
My daughters COVID negative. Back to school tomorrow they go!
While we cannot enforce testing, we advise anyone who was at MCM or CfZ to test for Covid before turning up to BristolFurs this weekend.
I need covid/surgery exhaustion to go tf away kthxbai
Why not treat high gas prices like COVID days, stop driving anywhere, stop buying it .... it will go down. #PROTESTGAS
Isolated in my house with COVID so I guess it’s as good of a time as any to watch The Batman.
Feeling like hammered hell. Home Covid test negative. Also went amd got another test we'll see. Hopefully this is just a bitch of a summer cold. Weird thing to hope for, I know.
Damn everyone got covid this weekend at them Memorial Day/graduation parties
The reason I never got Covid was because as a child my family let me play in the creek after they would eat chicken wings and I would collect the chicken bones thinking it was from a pack of wild chickens
"Pretty sure @pgcps still requires 100% mask wear. We’re at my daughter’s concert @BTMSTigers - teachers &amp; audience w/o masks &amp; no administrators/leadership present that I can see. Why have rules if no one enforces them?
#COVID #ThisIsWhyWeCantHaveNiceThings"
In another disappointing blow for COVID, COVID makes gin taste like yellow Triaminic. Was yellow Triaminic just a terrible gin reduction syrup all along?
let's gooo covid free
Boys flat out, is Covid gone? How come nobody gets it anymore
My ass done tested positive for COVID for the 3rd damn time. I am sick of this shit 😒
This girl that works at the gym got on me about my mask when that shit was a thing. Now, some days she wears one and others she doesn't. Guess she has a covid detector or some shit. 🤔
"I estimate my temperature to be 833674847352567478484° at the moment.

With raging covid and lunatics shooting up schools, grocery stores and hospitals, there's never been a better time to be an agoraphobe. It seems crazy to LEAVE home at this point tbh.
Trump willingly let COVID-19 ravage the fucking planet and Biden couldn’t foresee the baby formula shortage so both sides!
The person in line in front of me at the pharmacy is here buying COVID tests. Coughing. Not wearing a mask. Ugh.
Srsly Covid fatigue hits different this shit sucks I can't even work like I used to I have to lay down every few hrs wtf
My brother-in-law is a Trump voter, a deer-huntin’ redneck, but we have some great debates sitting in the garage drinkin beer. He’s Christian but is cool w/ the gays; he even went to a couple gay bars with me and my sister &amp; had a blast. And he’s not a COVID conspirator either.
June first and I test positive for Covid, what a great start to pride month for me
Good Irl news I’m getting my second Covid shot before my I go on the Caribbean cruise in July pretty awesome

"Imagine you have appendicitis and MSJMC send you home because you have covid

Wtf?!?!?!"
Hospitals in our area have seen hundreds of patients for long-COVID in the past year. Latest CDC report shows 20% of adults have a health condition that could be from having COVID. Anyone experiencing long-lasting COVID symptoms that would want to do an interview with us tonight?
aight, time to see how horrible working out with COVID is
Having Covid suuuuuuuuuucks
Bitch, this country is going to shit! Shoots. Covid-19!! Now some damn monkey pox!!! Wtf is NEXT??
"it's crazy how many people quit working and bragged about abusing covid payments that are pissed they have to pay it back now...

but it's also crazy how canada forced it over EI, overpaid, told people they wouldnt have to pay it back, and are ruining lives to get it back now."
Now the freaks on Fox are trying to blame Marijuana for the cause of shootings. I think they need to drug test those people, forget the Covid test😝I remember the 60s and Woodstock and don’t remember Maraguana being a problem. All peace and love😝
i bet a woman wouldn't give me covid
You know what, my mum celebrates the jubilee. She’s English. I popped to see her as she’s got covid. I don’t hate everyone that’s into it. I don’t. Never will, pretty sure our kids won’t. But hate is not me. ❤️
tweeting at you live from the covid factory, the body aches just set in and i have to continue working for an hour and 15 mins. this sounds so dumb to say but i do not think i can do it i am actually miserable as fuck
Desantis allowed thousands in Florida to get infected with Covid and Abbott in Texas continues to support the selling of assault weapons dispite  multi mass shootings in that state to evil men .
can they just close down schools.. guns is the new pandemic , maybe those covid 19 studies were true . y'all became mentally ill
happy pride month i’ve acquired covid

in an rt mood lately. my entire brain is being occupied with having covid and also gay thoughts for this crust punk guy in canada so
A cool thing about covid recovery is that now when I go for my little walks, I get so tired I throw up 🤩🤩🤩
"Trumper to me this morning: 
“So! What do you think of world depopulation?” (I guess there’s a Q Covid/deliberate depopulation conspiracy??)
Me: “Well, you and I know there’s enough Stupid in the world to spread a virus w/out a plan behind it.(he looks thoughtful) But between 1"
hearing bryan talk to his grandpa who has Covid, and he’s finally feeling better, makes my heart so warm ❤️❤️❤️
"So, today I tested positive for COVID, but I also had a poem nominated for an award (more on that later), it's the first day of #Pride, and a certain walking turd whose initials are ""TC"" has brought the holy wrath of BTS stans down upon himself. I'll take it."
If Covid didn’t make me more on an introvert…daily mass shootings in this country certainly will
Couldn't cross the street to say hi to friends. Wahhh over having this covid plague
"hi, i’m still inactive 
i’ll be active when i feel like it &lt;3

small life update
it’s summer break for me
i’m feeling better from covid 
i start school again on 8/10 i think 
i’m getting highlights soon, reply if you want to see photos of it when i get them done"
Got my 2nd breakthrough COVID and unlike the first time... its kicking ass 😷
"Today MSM outlets are proceeding with their regularly scheduled programs while another mass shooting happened in Tulsa. I think our society has become, ""comfortably numb"" with this stuff. We can ignore climate, covid, and gun massacres now. A species bent on wiping itself out."

The rise of Long COVID will make it harder to maintain the current state of civilization."

It took one baby to die before they closed the largest baby formula manufacturer in the US, but how many have died or injured from the Covid vaccine and it still is on the market?
"""Non-COVID-related illness"" sounds so scandalous and embarrassing.  I would be like ""Please just tell everyone that I have COVID.  A lot of it.""  #BlueJays"
People are dying in Ukraine. People are still dying of covid. People are dying of other diseases. And much of it was overshadowed the past few months by a trial between 2 rich celebrities hating each other. I don't get it 🤷‍♂️
"Leaving the EU didn’t give the UK greater freedom on vaccines or help to Ukraine.

The EU has achieved far more than the UK on Covid &amp; Ukraine. Sure, it’s much bigger. But also individual EU countries have achieved more relative to size.

Claiming otherwise is just embarrassing."
After a hiatus due to COVID, long serving staff in @louis_riel_sd were recognized this evening; 174 employees with 25 or more years of service for total of 5,060 years  in LRSD. Thank you for your commitment and your dedication and for sharing all or part of your career with us.

The thing that kills me abour KE is when they say Covid changed everything lol like for who eve and villanelle they didn’t live in a time of Covid how the fuck I mean yes here in the time but not their story #killingeve what an excuse to use
I think if you are a Georgian and vote for hershell you are an idiot - walker’s murky-ass financial records, his body spray that promises to “kill the COVID,” he lied about graduating from U of GA, his doubt about human evolution, and most of all his history of Domestic Violence.
"First workout since getting covid, and it was TERRIBLE.
But it was better than nothing, so I'll take it, for now."
Everyone has covid in the house im getting sick too let's go!
