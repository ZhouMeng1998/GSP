Love getting COVID exposed by my idiot coworker who was feeling sick yesterday but decided to snot all over the lab instead of wearing a mask
"Hepatitis C Virus Reactivation Following COVID-19 Vaccination

“She had a reactivation of hepatitis C infection after vaccination with the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This reactivation manifested with jaundice, loss of consciousness, hepatic coma and death”"
"memorial day weekend was a dream
1. face the facts that i don't know anyone in this timezone
2. spiral and start a 1000 piece puzzle
3. get covid"
Many people I know on the left have resisted the covid hysteria, but seem blind to how badly the past two years of destructive policies have demolished credibility and goodwill for @TheDemocrats. I just don’t know how to make them see it.
When you test positive for Covid but find out your offer has been accepted on your dream home on the same day. Only living life at the extremes here.
4/15 ppl in my office (though i think it might be 5 bc one cw has been sketchy) has had COVID in the last ~3-4 weeks
Feels fitting to miss out on my last week of field work for a job that moved to in May of 2020 - due to a COVID exposure in 2022.
If a million people in America died from covid, shouldn't the housing market sell off, because there are a million empty homes?
Just got a delivery of one of my favorite perfumes. I haven’t had it since I broke my last bottle about a year ago. But today I just smell… vaguely sweet nothing? Crap. Is this a Covid thing? I hadn’t noticed any loss of smell before. Or maybe this perfume batch is weird?
I have a day off today, not because I have covid or intolerable pain or doctor appointments, but just because I can. It's nice.
One thing Covid fucked up was me missing H.E.R. because my test didn't came back in enough time
There are 27 letters in the new email handle for communicating about Covid issues at @WWU. That's more than letters in the alphabet. I'm trying not to see the implied message behind such a user-unfriendly email. . .
nice lil paid covid vacation
I've been consuming extreme levels of honey to help this covid throat
just like COVID if everyone is looking at the shootings what do you expect is going to happen... wearing a mask or wearing a firearm i guess there both the same in a sense or protection #2A
to everyone listening to me blowing my nose: it is ALLERGIES. I have taken 5 covid tests
"Got engaged.
Faience got COVID the day after.
Been sleeping on the couch with the dogs ever since.
And I’ve just been working nonstop.
I’m so worried I’m going to get this shit. 😫"
Colossalcon Walmart is what’s gonna give me covid
One week into Covid chronicles, praise God I don’t have aches, but it sure is messing with my mentality. I need all the Jesus on the forefront of my mind. Lesson learned you can have mild symptoms but it will come for your thoughts. Guard it with all your heart! Not today Satan!
"Looks like covid is gone
Happy June 2022"
So is COVID over and Monkeypox the new MSM/Government scare tactic? Or will COVID 'mutate' again and create an even less, I mean more powerful/deadly virus just in time for the midterms?
happy gay month i have acquired covid
"So lastnight i had really bad chills, stomach pain, fatigue and other systems. Thought it might be covid but the test was negative.
It's fading today but im still not yet 100%. Have been very tired all day. Think it's probably norovirus."
I've managed to successfully dodge #covid so far and up until today, anything involving the #DeppVHeardTrial
if i have covid again im just going to go lay in the road
Seems very likely that Covid finally caught up to me. My rapid test this morning was negative, but I have all the symptoms (mild, thankfully). If you were at the Chicago Open chess tournament last weekend you should get tested ASAP.
Can anyone fill me in on how Twitter post covid is? still horny as? And is nihilism still a hit, or did that go out the door with the lib party
First day of covid! Well second day considering I had the most of the fever when my test still said negative. So far I've watched 1 season of Nathan for You and Harry Potter movies 3-8 I'm thinking a rewatch of Heros next wyt
Or is it covid?😭😭😂
Starting off gay month by getting COVID 😷🤧🤒
Update: I have Covid 😭
"The inflation is being caused by the prior over-spending for ""COVID relief"".  The damage has been done.  There is no way now to reduce the inflation.  Americans just have to adjust to a lower standard of living for the next decade or so."
got my covid test done and it's negative! THANK GOD! ✈️🇰🇷 tmrw!
Gun violence just overtook Ukraine and Covid for flavor of the month. Sorry LGBTQ, you get shunned again 🌈😂🖕
When you got covid so your mom has to go to the liquor store for you
Greeting,local cluster! Playing Breath of the Wild is a meaningful routine of being happy in order to not go crazy during covid time, My human once told me a story:  Alex, who is a nurse, she  took care of global warming, and she  saved a village from the deadly virus
Before Covid and even now at some places, you can walk straight up into a hospital with no questions asked, lol they’re really not safe
intacta do covid fml 🙌🏻💪🏻
Totally random info while waiting for #AEWDynamite to start. I haven’t been feel well off and on for a long time. A lot existing symptoms/medical conditions have worsened since I had #covid back in January. Really starting to think I’ve got #LongCovid.
"VanDeRock Funeral &amp; Cremation Services has seen its business nearly triple in the last few years.
Sad to see Covid go."
To com covid ebaaa  🎉😭
I’ve been super congested, coughing sneezing, DOUBLE PINK EYE. I was so scared I had COVID.. but good news.. ITS ALLERGIES. Also@bad news.. I’m allergic to everything

I wonder if ppl still think covid killed 6 million people 😂
"I have COVID. I think I'm OK. 3 days in. 

This blows, though."
"Don’t blame President Biden for the outrageously high #gasprices

Donald Trump let COVID-19 get out of hand in 2020 which led to a lockdown, no one travelled thereby reducing gas prices

Now people are traveling again since Biden got COVID under control

Also, Putin started a war"
I know I'm asking a lot but if #AEWDynamite could make me forget I have Covid for two hours then I'd be real grateful.
missing the first Center City SIPS of the summer. fuck covid
So my sister got covid and is feeling/looks and sounds terrible. She meets criteria for Paxlovid. Her doctor says I don’t know the drug well so I don’t prescribe it ever and then prescribes Azithromycin. Are you kidding me. This is where we are still. In the Bay Area to boot.
"covid : 1 
e : 0"
"I'm so over the MSM neg stories on hospitals. This is ""living with covid"" isn't it? How about they focus on telling people to wear masks, ventilate areas, meet outside, keep distanced &amp; get vaxxed? No interventions = spread right? #CovidIsNotOver  #covid19vic"
I like how we all think that big artists doing NFTs (ex. Madonna, Doja Cat, etc.) are a big deal… when it’s really just the record labels trying to get more money “cuz COVID shut down live events”. 🥴
i’m gunna be so mad if i caught covid at that midnight t show
I think I got covid again cause ain’t no way my body aching nose running like a cheetah 😭😩 I’m never going out again. You filthy animals
I wonder how the “Covid is a hoax” people are doing?

didn’t know that muscle cramps/weakness was a covid side effect, but if i even think about moving out of turn my legs seize up 😶‍🌫️ also thrown my neck out from coughing!!! which is a cute fun lil thing
You know what would be a great idea, how about we get transmission down again but hear me out instead of declaring victory early we keep doing it until Covid is just controllable flair ups instead of a raging wildfire all over the country? I know, not going to happen, too hard
Worst part of Covid for me so far (3 days in) is a tie between sleepless sweaty nights and the R.O.A.D. (Rapid Onset Adult Diarrhea)
Idk something about a Covid vaccination commercial encouraging ppl to get outside is so dark sided
IM STILL POSITIVE WITH COVID WHAGTBE FUCK
Those first like 4 weeks of COVID before it got stale was lowkey fire outside of the people dying
it’s giving COVID. it’s me. im sick
The GOP was upset that children were kept out of school due to covid.But now teachers are quitting because the GOP don’t want to keep our teachers safe &amp; pass gun safety laws.When will they do what’s right for the people instead of thinking only about how much money they can get!
Don't let Covid-19 bring you down! Instead, have a spa day.
Slight improvement in leaness. Coming back post covid siu
This is every year with all these shootings. When everyone was on lockdown because of COVID, it wasn’t an issue. SMH 🤦🏽‍♀️
another week, another shooting. it's like covid, we're all getting hit eventually.
"irony learning the firm that sold mie to another (likely bc I wouldn’t share vaxx status) mandated staff back to their office now 
1 year later- a bunch got COVID in the first two weeks.  

Yikes. 

whatevs! Freelancers go where the money is, while not returning to any office."
We had an Indian place around the corner for approximately 15 days but some scandale has occurred and “closed 2 weeks cause someone got COVID” became closed forever. Mystery malfeasance
quite frankly if my blood pee and covid don’t get me a deadline extension i dont know what will
Denial is a strong American trait. If we ignore it or don’t report it, it doesn’t exist and isn’t a problem. #massshooting #covid
Getting Covid the first day of pride is the most homophobic thing that the universe could pull on me rn
Feeling achy. Hope its not the flu, covid, monkey pox or D. All of the above
What are the odds that both principal &amp; understudy get sick during tech week? I reported to the team that I tested positive for covid. Then they posted a message that two cast members tested +. I noticed that my principal wasn't at rehearsal today and yes, he's the other + guy.
I’ve had covid for seven days and I’d really like to stay awake until the sun goes down. Maybe tomorrow.
Has anyone been hearing that the gov-provided orange box COVID tests are faulty? Frequent false negatives? 🥴
I had Covid last year for my bday i got make up for it &amp; I be 25🤕
I’m more frightened of getting shot than getting Covid.  @POTUS Executive Order NOW!
parem d ter covid
Anyone who’s interacted with me on social media in the past couple of days might want to get tested for Covid
We sure quit talking bout the COVID CORONAVIRUS suddenly, didn’t we?
This is the third Pride month since I came out in 2020 and the third I can’t safely attend because nobody cares about people who are high risk for COVID
Seething with anger right now at @RWalensky @CDCgov @POTUS Your political calculus re Covid is putting me at daily risk. I do not go to bars or eat inside at restaurants, but I work in an open office with 20 somethings who are in bars all weekend and bringing Covid to the office
How many years after the Covid scam will stores take down those stupid plastic barriers? 8? 10?
#DoFo @fordnation it's been 1,217 days or over 3 years since you got @HonDavidOnley report. Calls for strong new action on #accessibility for people w/ #disabilities. We need a real action plan. Your delays create more hardships during #COVID #AODA
guess who might have covid 😀
I would like to see the data on long covid stratified according to self-employed, small business, corporate and public sector.
The biggest thing I’ve been missing since Covid started is back and I’m LIVING
A4: Since 2016-2017, there's been something (new baby, new standards, COVID) that shook up the school year, so I'm excited that next year will be on where I can focus on refining and not building from scratch. #MCPchat
"Don’t know whether to blame age, the draining difficulty of the school year, or after-effects from covid, but this is the first time ever I haven’t had a perfect report card from my PCP after a checkup.

I’m still aware that I’m extremely lucky, but it’s weird to need follow-up."
This weird combination of lies, anarchy and christofascism the #CultRight is perpetrating on America is destabilizing the country far more than record inflation and covid.
eeee to com covid
Stuck in bed with Covid and I've run out of papers to write, so I'm pondering the important questions in life, like how much anxiety is the normal amount of anxiety?
Covid ruined my life
I just had a doctor tell me to Google stuff about Covid bc it changes daily. Mmmk
Trust me to get sick on the extra holiday (sticky sticks say I don’t have Covid &amp; neighbour’s kids are also down with a non-Covid bug)
"Why is anyone surprised that airlines are cancelling flights due to staff shortages?

Of course they are! 

Of course the staff got covid! 

Of course removing masks from airplanes during a pandemic is a horrible idea!

Disabled people have been saying this from the start."
happy pride month everyone i’ve been exposed to covid
Glad that I don’t have covid but also that just means that I’m just mystery sick… hate it here what is going onnn
"I continue to just be so disenfranchised with society, given that our answer to parents over two years into a pandemic is ""just send your unvaccinated babies to daycare despite the rising cases and the unknown long term effects of COVID as a virus."""
Mano fuck COVID #infected
Getting my positive Covid test result on the first day of Pride has got to be some form of biphobia, right?
Making a summer bucket list and a summer playlist so I feel less sad about having my first week of my summer being ruined by covid 😭😭
can’t smash with covid bahahHa
Who tf gets COVID 3 times like this shit is just wild AF yo
Pfizer $PFE just released a Covid-19 vaccine for kids aged 6 months to 4 years old, lining up its coffers with vax revenues $NVAX $JNJ $MRNA
Hey y’all I’m sorry Covid is kicking my butt today, I’ll try to stream tomorrow love y’all ❤️💛💙
I beat Covid's spiky pimple ass. And I'm with Johnny.
Remember the same party that didn't care people were dying of covid are the same people that don't care about mass shootings
Oh my god, do the COVID coughing fits ever stop?
"Covid ✔️

Depp vs Heard ✔️
NOW GET BACK TO WORK!!!"
"We must give people their jobs back who were sacked because of their COViD vaccination status. 

The mandates must end now. 

Too many industries are in crisis. 
Too many people have had their careers and livelihoods put on ice. 

We cannot let this continue."
i dont think canada could have fucked up their covid response any harder than they did and it still infuriates me to think about. we're STILL fucking it up.
Yes where all this evidence that not only did the police Commissioner used to mandate but all the employers of whom sack their workers for not getting vaccinated hmmm I see a lot court actions in the near future all I can say this serves you right going for the covid cash cow
Why i cldnt have covid and just b home fine? I need to be taking adv of this home time. But alas im bed stricken
Not even tryna be funny but it’s like bullets saw the amount of bodies that Covid claimed and got jealous.
"Four Horsemen of Apocalypse:
I see war with Russia &amp; Ukraine as well as others around the globe. I see pestilence &amp; death with Covid-19 &amp; other afflictions worldwide. Who seems others and in what?"
Covid was just one big game of hidden in plain sight
"I’m a Scorpio and I didn’t get COVID for two years.

So Astrology prevents COVID, but it only stops the spread entirely if everyone is a Scorpio."
Last week I had a slight fever which I informed my coach of since I can't come to work. So the clinic advised me to have my 7 days quarantined even though we're on covid alert level 1. And today would have my clearance and fit to work. 🙏
"Thought my chest had escaped this time. It was waiting for DAY4.

I’m upstate for a wedding and half of the guests can’t go because they have COVID but yeah go off don’t wear a mask at hannaford
I just don't know how you redeem a society so okay with so much death as long as few corporations make a profit. Mass shootings. Covid. Healthcare. This isn't sustainable. This isn't a status quo worth leaving fundamentally unchanged.
Not alot of my friends actually know that I was born, raised and educated in Canada. I accepted a position in the US after receiving a few offers. I have dual citizenships and the only thing missing is a clean covid test within 96 hours. In case you missed me 1/2
"Is there a non-COVID virus ripping through the Philly area right now?  Got sick last weekend and have been on my ass for 4 days now but tested neg for COVID twice in that span. Congestion, cough, fever, exhaustion. 

Whatever it is, it sucks."
Why is it that ever drug commercial list all the side effects but when you see a covid shot/ treatment pill they list no side effects? I think they are hiding the truth
So much for protecting ourselves from Covid …. Now we have to protect ourselves from shooters showing up at random places.
fuck me....i think i caught covid from my dad 💀
This marg ain’t tastin right 😞 shoutout Covid
i been so bored in the crib covid sucks
My daughters COVID negative. Back to school tomorrow they go!
While we cannot enforce testing, we advise anyone who was at MCM or CfZ to test for Covid before turning up to BristolFurs this weekend.
I need covid/surgery exhaustion to go tf away kthxbai
Why not treat high gas prices like COVID days, stop driving anywhere, stop buying it .... it will go down. #PROTESTGAS
Isolated in my house with COVID so I guess it’s as good of a time as any to watch The Batman.
Feeling like hammered hell. Home Covid test negative. Also went amd got another test we'll see. Hopefully this is just a bitch of a summer cold. Weird thing to hope for, I know.
Damn everyone got covid this weekend at them Memorial Day/graduation parties
The reason I never got Covid was because as a child my family let me play in the creek after they would eat chicken wings and I would collect the chicken bones thinking it was from a pack of wild chickens
"Pretty sure @pgcps still requires 100% mask wear. We’re at my daughter’s concert @BTMSTigers - teachers &amp; audience w/o masks &amp; no administrators/leadership present that I can see. Why have rules if no one enforces them?
#COVID #ThisIsWhyWeCantHaveNiceThings"
In another disappointing blow for COVID, COVID makes gin taste like yellow Triaminic. Was yellow Triaminic just a terrible gin reduction syrup all along?

Boys flat out, is Covid gone? How come nobody gets it anymore
My ass done tested positive for COVID for the 3rd damn time. I am sick of this shit 😒

With raging covid and lunatics shooting up schools, grocery stores and hospitals, there's never been a better time to be an agoraphobe. It seems crazy to LEAVE home at this point tbh.
Trump willingly let COVID-19 ravage the fucking planet and Biden couldn’t foresee the baby formula shortage so both sides!
The person in line in front of me at the pharmacy is here buying COVID tests. Coughing. Not wearing a mask. Ugh.
Srsly Covid fatigue hits different this shit sucks I can't even work like I used to I have to lay down every few hrs wtf
My brother-in-law is a Trump voter, a deer-huntin’ redneck, but we have some great debates sitting in the garage drinkin beer. He’s Christian but is cool w/ the gays; he even went to a couple gay bars with me and my sister &amp; had a blast. And he’s not a COVID conspirator either.
June first and I test positive for Covid, what a great start to pride month for me

Hospitals in our area have seen hundreds of patients for long-COVID in the past year. Latest CDC report shows 20% of adults have a health condition that could be from having COVID. Anyone experiencing long-lasting COVID symptoms that would want to do an interview with us tonight?

"it's crazy how many people quit working and bragged about abusing covid payments that are pissed they have to pay it back now...

but it's also crazy how canada forced it over EI, overpaid, told people they wouldnt have to pay it back, and are ruining lives to get it back now."
Now the freaks on Fox are trying to blame Marijuana for the cause of shootings. I think they need to drug test those people, forget the Covid test😝I remember the 60s and Woodstock and don’t remember Maraguana being a problem. All peace and love😝
i bet a woman wouldn't give me covid
You know what, my mum celebrates the jubilee. She’s English. I popped to see her as she’s got covid. I don’t hate everyone that’s into it. I don’t. Never will, pretty sure our kids won’t. But hate is not me. ❤️
tweeting at you live from the covid factory, the body aches just set in and i have to continue working for an hour and 15 mins. this sounds so dumb to say but i do not think i can do it i am actually miserable as fuck
Desantis allowed thousands in Florida to get infected with Covid and Abbott in Texas continues to support the selling of assault weapons dispite  multi mass shootings in that state to evil men .

People are dying in Ukraine. People are still dying of covid. People are dying of other diseases. And much of it was overshadowed the past few months by a trial between 2 rich celebrities hating each other. I don't get it 🤷‍♂️
"Leaving the EU didn’t give the UK greater freedom on vaccines or help to Ukraine.

The EU has achieved far more than the UK on Covid &amp; Ukraine. Sure, it’s much bigger. But also individual EU countries have achieved more relative to size.

The thing that kills me abour KE is when they say Covid changed everything lol like for who eve and villanelle they didn’t live in a time of Covid how the fuck I mean yes here in the time but not their story #killingeve what an excuse to use
I think if you are a Georgian and vote for hershell you are an idiot - walker’s murky-ass financial records, his body spray that promises to “kill the COVID,” he lied about graduating from U of GA, his doubt about human evolution, and most of all his history of Domestic Violence.

I have COVID. 0/10 do not recommend

First Covid kept us in the house now these mass shootings everyday it’s becoming a true pandemic of guns at this point
What is the scientific way to decide if *I* would benefit from a Covid booster given my personal health profile and (low) exposure? Titer test to measure immunity decay since previous booster? Do they even protect against current variants?

I have a ton of hand sewing piled up. I'm considering doing an 80s movie a night for a week to sew+embroider by. Desperately Seeking Susan, Lost Boys, and Less Than Zero? Surprisingly, not Vibes because I rewatched it way too many times during Covid lockdown, burned out on it.
You cant say a bad word about covid or stray from force fed opinions in the media or your account is removed while these thinspiration accounts are allowed and stay up.
Wonder how the @Cubs unvaxxed RF weathered Covid?

"I’m getting an experimental drug for COVID-vulnerable people &amp; the  warning sheet is so amusing. For allergies it says “don’t take drug X if you’re allergic to it.” for side effects it just lists all the side effects of an allergic reaction

“good luck, Godspeed” basically"
"I can’t catch a break. I got better from Covid but now I’m sick with what the doctor believes is salmonella. 

I’ve lost 12 pound in 7 days.  So watch out, I’m feeling myself lmao jk I feel like shit."
Long covid sucks and I've been so painful I had to call off work today but in better news, I passed my skill test and leveled up so I'll get a raise soon 😸
#MonkeypoxVirus hard for me to believe it's a coincidence that two separate diseases bat-origin covid and monkey origin monkey pox..both studied and apparently enhanced during those studies at biowarfare and 'for the science of it' labs suddenly break out one after the other
covid tests still make me feel like i’ve just realized my period is late
Not Covid being homophobic on June 1st to me…
Tested positive for COVID.  God's way of making me watch IEM Dallas.
If I won the lottery, I would found a bank on the principle that it’s okay to use the drive-thru ATM if you’re a pedestrian and there’s no other ATM. How in 2022 are you going to tell us the lobby is closed from COVID and we can’t walk through the drive-thru? We live in a society
bro this covid shit sucks so bad i want to eat desperately and haven’t been able to for like 2 days thankfully i’m vaxxed bc i feel like this would be so much worse
"When will everyone in power wake up and realize you need a multi level approach to solving country wide problems. It's so aggravating that every puts political blinders on to try to ""solve"" a problem. Was the same bullshit with covid."
Now that the Hollywood court case is over can we get back to the Covid scare some more, I mean I saw people out today talking and living life like it used to be.
when i go to set a timer it's already at either 15 minutes or 6.5 minutes because the only two things i time are covid tests and medium boiled eggs
Apparently the Dublin airport staff that were let go during covid, were offered their jobs back, but at a lesser wage! #thecheek
Kinda homophobic I get covid for a second time on the first of pride month but okay🙄

We are 2.5 years into Covid and ppl don’t know NOT TO BLOW YOUR NOSE ON A PLANE NEXT TO SOMEONE? #FFS
Sorry Uber driver for the sniffles I don’t have covid I’ve just been crying
People with HIV should be quarantined. Natural follow up of COVID science.
It's hard for me to care there are fatalities in a shooting in Tulsa when over 2200 people died from Covid yesterday alone😢
"Disappointed to learn from first hand experience that @ORDeptEd and ""Ready Schools Safe Learners,"" along w/ @PPSConnect are NOT in compliance with @CDCgov recommendations for COVID-19 isolation. Learned from my son who got covid at school, and the response we've gotten fr school."
"Whooooboy!  Lots of Covid right now!  Be careful out there!!

❤️"
remember when covid first started and everybody was minding they damn business 😔 i miss that
my exams are open book because of covid and I honestly have no clue how people did these exams pre-covid because there is simply too much information for anyone to actually know all of it in detail
If you’re not vaccinated, this is your sign. Covid just sent me to the hospital
Lots of people still getting COVID, it's in the never endemic phase
There's a flu bug going around and it's not covid 🤧🤧🤧
My weirdest covid symptom was being hella horny
Don't let Covid-19 bring you down! Instead, clean out your closet.
"Covid ""left"" and the white boys decided to shoot again"
In the last 48 hours, 8 people I know have gotten Covid. So if you’re feeling particularly free and flip, just know we are in the middle of a huge surge with no messaging to the public to protect themselves.
I had Covid over a month ago and i am still suffering from extreme and frequent brain fog and exhaustion AND I AM STILL FUCKING COUGHING. THE COUGH WILL NOT GO AND I AM TIRED.
#Uvalde #Ukraine #GlobalWarming #HumanRights #COVID #January6th to name a few, but sure #JohnnyDepp.
Legionaires and Covid have the same symptoms. So like huh?
I decided to do a bit more investigation into my COVID positive veterinarian. He tested positive last Tues and we saw him on Monday. I talked to the tech I  know well and she told me they have several patients that saw him Monday and Tuesday who are now sick &gt;
of course i would get covid the week i sign up to do 3 bonus shifts at work 💀 i just know my boss is mad lmaoooo
The days when all we had to worry about was covid
"Thinking about young children, I realized we really messed up, didn't we? They will never know the 'before or after Covid'. They will only get to experience years of endless diseases one after the other

We did not act like responsible adults that cared about the next generation"
Not me oversharing about my long COVID symptoms in the group chat with anti-mask family members.
my sister and her friend my have covid 😺😺 fucking great
Everyone catching covid right now
"Does Fauci alone have the authority to commit the government to purchase continuous Covid-19 vaccines? 

Now add the purchase of another unproven, Fauci advocated, vaccine for Monkeypox, with minimal therapeutic benefit."
Worked out for the first time since getting covid and barely made it halfway through a routine. Not sure if it was all the malaise these past 2 weeks or if I'm actually more fatigued but either way it sucks
i just woke up and jungwoo was tested positive for covid im gonna beat the shit out of this virus
"Mask mandates increase death rate
Contrary to the accepted thought that fewer people are dying comparing data between counties in Kansas found that those that mandated masks for COVID-19 had a higher rate of death than those that did not. 
German physician Zacharias Foegen"
First time mowing lawn post covid and I didn't feel like collapsing. Progress!
MedTwitter question: How many of your offices are currently understaffed to severely understaffed because of workers out sick with COVID?
Social media peaked during covid lockdown. Unbeatable.
Got all the free Covid tests in the mail today. I now have 16 tests and I’ll probably give a bunch away because we don’t test
So now I gotta pray my wife gets fed. That she doesn’t catch Covid. That she can get off at 12 hours and not at 15. And not if she’s had active shooter training. Bc anybody who knows Jasmine knows she ain’t leaving her patients behind.
I swear if I got Covid for the second time…
I have a 2 hour kick off meeting with clients this afternoon (on teams) and I am so breathless from Covid idk how I’m gonna talk for 2 hours?! Need to catch my breath after a couple sentences lol
Why is no one wearing masks anymore? COVID or not, ya still ugly n your breath still stinks
Covid couldn’t take me out. I used to eat pizza rolls on the toilet. #totinos #pizza #becomeungovernable
"Dafuq ! 

JUST IN - @pfizer asked the FDA to authorize its three-injections #COVID vaccine for ""emergency use"" in children ages 6 months to under 5 years old. #Pfizer"
do u guys think stretch marks r ugly? i struggle with them from when i was at my highest weight (from being an absolute slob during early covid) and even though i’ve lost weight they r still there :((( any tips on how to get rid of them?
So today I tested positive for Covid… like wtf?! I never had Covid before even when it was at its highest peak so I’m confused
".@US_FDA There is No ""Emergency"" to shove Covid shots on our babies/healthy young children. COVID vaccine for ""emergency use"" in children Just Stop
@Pfizer asked the FDA to authorize its three-injections for 6 months to under 5 years old."
Not that COVID testing isn’t free anymore 😂😂😂
Hire the nurses back who aren't vaxxed and BC wouldn't have to close some nessesary hospitals because of nurses calling in sick with covid.  None of the un-vaxxed are sick, how fucking stupid is the gov't
why do i feel guilty for having to make a minimum payment on my card even though i'm broke, have covid, and can't work? is it capitalism?
Positive for COVID 👍
Mrs C got her 4th vax shot while I have to wait another couple months because I caught the Covid and now she’s lording her invulnerability over me as she should.
"The perp in Tulsa at Warren Clinic
was likely fueled by COVID-conspiracy fever
Thanks, GOP."
#Covid9: Here we are in #Taiwan with nearly 90.000 cases a day and still strict quarantine rules to enter the country. It is like trying to stop a drop going to the ocean.  I wonder what we have learned after 2.5 years of Covid... Sad😢😭
"I know its no longer trendy to have covid but. Wife and daughter have it, I must likely have it aswell.

Wife and daughters have mild symptoms.

Im asymptomatic."
"2020-2021: don’t leave your house, Covid

"my mom's aunt joked about my mom getting pregnant but its a fucking COVID test. 

Shes not pregnant lmao"
"Covid fucking sucks
I feel fine most of the day and then suddenly while doing anything I enjoy my energy is gone"
There’s someone here at the pharmacy panicking about their positive COVID test, and in the same breath, confirming her plans to go to a concert tomorrow. Love this timeline.
"The most recent 7-day moving average is over 100,000 new covid cases a DAY.

@elonmusk is saying everyone who doesn't want to show up in person can ""pretend to work somewhere else"" and that he'll ""assume they've resigned.""

Elon Musk is an ableist shitbag."
Covid has been evil ok
I love that I was losing sleep over having Covid and it’s turned out to be less of a pain than a head cold
my mom might have covid 😦
at what point does the anger towards “officials” (?) from having long covid symptoms — which fully upend your daily life — leave your body? asking for me as I cannot take this any longer 🫠
Finally Covid negative 9 days after symptoms started 🙃
"June 1: AB COVID 19 data round up

The #covid #cowards and #sheep … don’t ever forget those weak people in your life and the soul suckers on the #media.
Guess who has Covid Pt. 2?!
Pre-trip covid test anxiety is so real. Can’t even get excited about traveling anymore until the day before your flight departs 😩
My luck finally ran out. Got the Covid at the convention. So did the friend I was sitting with. There was a coughing/sneezing dude right behind us. Day-umm!
What happened to plandemic? I don’t hear any talk about viruses anymore. Guess Covid and the variants disappeared
Only good thing to come out of COVID was it temporarily put a stop to all of the mass shootings in the country. But now that we’re back to normal, it’s becoming an everyday thing again
two fevers in a week have me feeling drained (it’s not covid btw just me with a weak immune system 👍🏻)
"ABC....Is Victoria the only state where there is an exceptional strain on the health systems because of the demands of Covid and the ‘flu ?

I’m a high school teacher of 27 years. I spent the last 2 trying to keep my kids learning and safe from Covid. Tomorrow I will be answering questions about being safe at the grocery store, school, and hospitals. #Uvalde #tulsa #Buffalo
Good morning everyone 🌞I’m dropping off a care pack to a young family with Covid tonight - apart from Panadol, soup, fruit, tissues, juice, strepsils, vitamins, bone broth - anything else that would be helpful? Thanks
I thought I had recovered a lot from covid/flu but family visited today and suggested I look like I need another day recovering (they’ve been child minding.) Going back to bed
#TrudeauTheTyrant's top secret federal science exempts unvaccinated foreign nationals who transit through Canadian airports from any covid screening, while Canadian citizens are not even given the option to test as an alternative to vaccination to board the same aircraft.
Previously, I never looked forward to summer as I had to constantly worry about keeping my kids engaged. But this year, it’s a blessing! The last school year was the worst with 3 Covid waves &amp; ever changing protocols. I need a breather before the fun starts again in 2 months!
having covid is so fucking horrible. i just want to feel betterrrrrr ugh
"no stream tonight pals! after managing to avoid it for over two years my husband has COVID and while i’m still negative, i don’t feel great and should probably just take it easy.

"So, my grandson LJ, graduates 8th grade today, with honors! 
We will watch it on YouTube, as only parents are allowed to go in person, due to COVID rates rising in our area. 
We are so proud of him. All straight A+’s throughout 7th and 8th grade.🥰"
If @POTUS doesn't have a single shred of care for the people in the #UnitedStates that he is going to kill over the simple cost of living. Then #WeThePeople should shut this country down for 2 weeks like covid did. Then #January6th would have looked like a flag football game.
"There are plenty of reasons not to like Joe Biden. The inflation isn't really one of them. Dem policies didn't do this, Covid did. And that should be stupidly obvious.

Unfortunately, tribalists are hellbent on misattributing inflation for electoral gain."
im 28 years old, and despite knowing better, i trusted a covid fart and shit my pants.
"Congrats Jamaica on your economic successes despite the challenges mounted by #Covid and #TheRussiaInvasion of Ukraine. 4 consecutive quarters of economic growth is 'Prosperity.

#TheCALvary, NOT concerned about #JohnnyDepp or #AmberHeard as long as they're alive.  There was JUST ANOTHER #MassShooting at a #hospital in #Tulsa #Oklahoma...Oh &amp; #USA is still facing #covid &amp; 68% nationwide shortage on #babyformula.  So I have NOT seen any of the trial
Well, here we go again. Placed another order with USPS for Covid tests on MAY 20. Rec'd confirmation but no shipping/tracking info yet. Nearly two weeks. You'd think by now this would be routine, but then these ARE the people who can't manage to keep my mail dry on wet days.
COVID sucks. I can't even enjoy dunking on bad takes or wrestling like a proper human without it hurting. call the army
Covid back popping again, everyone getting sick
Yeah planes can kiss my ass right now. Lmao not finna pay 1k for a domestic round trip flight and catch COVID while doing it.

I have Covid. 😭😭
Omg sorry for the delay AGAIN. Ended up with a fever. :( Got tested but no covid! I’m so sorry for all the wait, I’ll try to update ASAP.
Every  day a mass shooting  and/or the police  shooting  an innocent  person and people  wonder  why I stay home 90 % of the time... the world gets worse with each passing  day....and I didn't even mention  Covid  😔

I feel like absolute shit rn. I definitely spoke too soon of being Negative of COVID. 😅
Oh, btw the A in LGBTQIA+ isn't for ammosexuals. Y'all can piss right off. I don't like to kink shame but, piss of and keep on pissing off. I'd rather have covid than a gun.
but i’m too pretty to have covid why
During my covid illness I discovered the show Hacks. What a delightfully great show. Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder have such great chemistry. Worth the binge.
I am done hearing about Tory parties and how they should be fined. I'm not angry they had parties; I'm more concerned with why they weren't terrified to be around one another when they had all the data to show how dealt COVID is and why they had us all under house arrest.
Why tf are lateral flow test £15? Nvm, i don't need to know if i have covid i guess
"Recovering well post covid &amp; international travel.

Can I use the Abbott's BinaxNow COVID-19 home test kit too fly back too the u.s? I plan on going back too canada, but I still see that the u.s still had not changed any restrictions. I've read online that this can be acceptable for travel has anyone tried this #travel #covid
Not me testing positive for COVID, but feeling good 😒

None of you think it's a bit interesting that Covid isn't a thing anymore, shootings are happening on every channel and midterms are coming up at the same time?
I remember when I had Covid I would not smoke because I thought my lungs were goin to collapse🤦🏿‍♀️ I was so scared. Whole time only couldn’t taste😅

I ate thru COVID bitch like who tf does that?
"Many upset COVID kept us home and isolated, BUT looking like the guns/shootings here in this Country doing the same, as no space is safe.

Crappy COVID week with little function…
The worst part about recovering from Covid is needing to see a physiotherapist after isolation ends because you’ve done something to your back with all the lying around
That stuck feeling be so annoying. But it’s fine I did it before just gotta flip out of it, if it wasn’t for covid or issuing resources to actually do the work we would be out of this and transitioned already. Dead ass just this retarded mf that’s gatekeeping my child

Covid is a hell of a diet I tell ya. Whew
So, charming, apparently I attended a super-spreader event and odds are good I have the covid. Which kinda stinks bc I'm pretty sure I already had it less than 3 months ago. Good thing I'm both a homebody and somewhat of a prepper, see y'all in a couple weeks. (1/2)

Covid-20. Upgraded mental effects and physical effects though the mental effects will take center stage. America now has only one problem. A people problem. I can’t wait for 21. But I will.
Do you think Covid immunity can be achieved and how difficult?
Seriously, COVID 19 is the only thing that can combat mass shootings in America.
it’s actually so homophobic that i still have covid
