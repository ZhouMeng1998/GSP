Love getting COVID exposed by my idiot coworker who was feeling sick yesterday but decided to snot all over the lab instead of wearing a mask
"Hepatitis C Virus Reactivation Following COVID-19 Vaccination

“She had a reactivation of hepatitis C infection after vaccination with the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This reactivation manifested with jaundice, loss of consciousness, hepatic coma and death”"
"memorial day weekend was a dream
1. face the facts that i don't know anyone in this timezone
2. spiral and start a 1000 piece puzzle
3. get covid"
Many people I know on the left have resisted the covid hysteria, but seem blind to how badly the past two years of destructive policies have demolished credibility and goodwill for @TheDemocrats. I just don’t know how to make them see it.
When you test positive for Covid but find out your offer has been accepted on your dream home on the same day. Only living life at the extremes here.
4/15 ppl in my office (though i think it might be 5 bc one cw has been sketchy) has had COVID in the last ~3-4 weeks
Feels fitting to miss out on my last week of field work for a job that moved to in May of 2020 - due to a COVID exposure in 2022.
If a million people in America died from covid, shouldn't the housing market sell off, because there are a million empty homes?
Just got a delivery of one of my favorite perfumes. I haven’t had it since I broke my last bottle about a year ago. But today I just smell… vaguely sweet nothing? Crap. Is this a Covid thing? I hadn’t noticed any loss of smell before. Or maybe this perfume batch is weird?
I have a day off today, not because I have covid or intolerable pain or doctor appointments, but just because I can. It's nice.
One thing Covid fucked up was me missing H.E.R. because my test didn't came back in enough time
There are 27 letters in the new email handle for communicating about Covid issues at @WWU. That's more than letters in the alphabet. I'm trying not to see the implied message behind such a user-unfriendly email. . .
nice lil paid covid vacation
I've been consuming extreme levels of honey to help this covid throat
just like COVID if everyone is looking at the shootings what do you expect is going to happen... wearing a mask or wearing a firearm i guess there both the same in a sense or protection #2A
to everyone listening to me blowing my nose: it is ALLERGIES. I have taken 5 covid tests
"Got engaged.
Faience got COVID the day after.
Been sleeping on the couch with the dogs ever since.
And I’ve just been working nonstop.
I’m so worried I’m going to get this shit. 😫"
Colossalcon Walmart is what’s gonna give me covid
One week into Covid chronicles, praise God I don’t have aches, but it sure is messing with my mentality. I need all the Jesus on the forefront of my mind. Lesson learned you can have mild symptoms but it will come for your thoughts. Guard it with all your heart! Not today Satan!
"Looks like covid is gone
Happy June 2022"
So is COVID over and Monkeypox the new MSM/Government scare tactic? Or will COVID 'mutate' again and create an even less, I mean more powerful/deadly virus just in time for the midterms?
happy gay month i have acquired covid
"So lastnight i had really bad chills, stomach pain, fatigue and other systems. Thought it might be covid but the test was negative.
It's fading today but im still not yet 100%. Have been very tired all day. Think it's probably norovirus."
I've managed to successfully dodge #covid so far and up until today, anything involving the #DeppVHeardTrial
if i have covid again im just going to go lay in the road
Seems very likely that Covid finally caught up to me. My rapid test this morning was negative, but I have all the symptoms (mild, thankfully). If you were at the Chicago Open chess tournament last weekend you should get tested ASAP.
Can anyone fill me in on how Twitter post covid is? still horny as? And is nihilism still a hit, or did that go out the door with the lib party
First day of covid! Well second day considering I had the most of the fever when my test still said negative. So far I've watched 1 season of Nathan for You and Harry Potter movies 3-8 I'm thinking a rewatch of Heros next wyt
Or is it covid?😭😭😂
Starting off gay month by getting COVID 😷🤧🤒
Update: I have Covid 😭
"The inflation is being caused by the prior over-spending for ""COVID relief"".  The damage has been done.  There is no way now to reduce the inflation.  Americans just have to adjust to a lower standard of living for the next decade or so."
got my covid test done and it's negative! THANK GOD! ✈️🇰🇷 tmrw!
Gun violence just overtook Ukraine and Covid for flavor of the month. Sorry LGBTQ, you get shunned again 🌈😂🖕
When you got covid so your mom has to go to the liquor store for you
Greeting,local cluster! Playing Breath of the Wild is a meaningful routine of being happy in order to not go crazy during covid time, My human once told me a story:  Alex, who is a nurse, she  took care of global warming, and she  saved a village from the deadly virus
Before Covid and even now at some places, you can walk straight up into a hospital with no questions asked, lol they’re really not safe
intacta do covid fml 🙌🏻💪🏻
Totally random info while waiting for #AEWDynamite to start. I haven’t been feel well off and on for a long time. A lot existing symptoms/medical conditions have worsened since I had #covid back in January. Really starting to think I’ve got #LongCovid.
"VanDeRock Funeral &amp; Cremation Services has seen its business nearly triple in the last few years.
Sad to see Covid go."
To com covid ebaaa  🎉😭
I’ve been super congested, coughing sneezing, DOUBLE PINK EYE. I was so scared I had COVID.. but good news.. ITS ALLERGIES. Also@bad news.. I’m allergic to everything

I wonder if ppl still think covid killed 6 million people 😂
"I have COVID. I think I'm OK. 3 days in. 

This blows, though."
"Don’t blame President Biden for the outrageously high #gasprices

Donald Trump let COVID-19 get out of hand in 2020 which led to a lockdown, no one travelled thereby reducing gas prices

Now people are traveling again since Biden got COVID under control

Also, Putin started a war"
I know I'm asking a lot but if #AEWDynamite could make me forget I have Covid for two hours then I'd be real grateful.
missing the first Center City SIPS of the summer. fuck covid
So my sister got covid and is feeling/looks and sounds terrible. She meets criteria for Paxlovid. Her doctor says I don’t know the drug well so I don’t prescribe it ever and then prescribes Azithromycin. Are you kidding me. This is where we are still. In the Bay Area to boot.
"covid : 1 
e : 0"
"I'm so over the MSM neg stories on hospitals. This is ""living with covid"" isn't it? How about they focus on telling people to wear masks, ventilate areas, meet outside, keep distanced &amp; get vaxxed? No interventions = spread right? #CovidIsNotOver  #covid19vic"
I like how we all think that big artists doing NFTs (ex. Madonna, Doja Cat, etc.) are a big deal… when it’s really just the record labels trying to get more money “cuz COVID shut down live events”. 🥴
i’m gunna be so mad if i caught covid at that midnight t show
I think I got covid again cause ain’t no way my body aching nose running like a cheetah 😭😩 I’m never going out again. You filthy animals
I wonder how the “Covid is a hoax” people are doing?

didn’t know that muscle cramps/weakness was a covid side effect, but if i even think about moving out of turn my legs seize up 😶‍🌫️ also thrown my neck out from coughing!!! which is a cute fun lil thing
You know what would be a great idea, how about we get transmission down again but hear me out instead of declaring victory early we keep doing it until Covid is just controllable flair ups instead of a raging wildfire all over the country? I know, not going to happen, too hard
Worst part of Covid for me so far (3 days in) is a tie between sleepless sweaty nights and the R.O.A.D. (Rapid Onset Adult Diarrhea)
Idk something about a Covid vaccination commercial encouraging ppl to get outside is so dark sided
IM STILL POSITIVE WITH COVID WHAGTBE FUCK
Those first like 4 weeks of COVID before it got stale was lowkey fire outside of the people dying
it’s giving COVID. it’s me. im sick
The GOP was upset that children were kept out of school due to covid.But now teachers are quitting because the GOP don’t want to keep our teachers safe &amp; pass gun safety laws.When will they do what’s right for the people instead of thinking only about how much money they can get!
Don't let Covid-19 bring you down! Instead, have a spa day.
Slight improvement in leaness. Coming back post covid siu
This is every year with all these shootings. When everyone was on lockdown because of COVID, it wasn’t an issue. SMH 🤦🏽‍♀️
another week, another shooting. it's like covid, we're all getting hit eventually.
"irony learning the firm that sold mie to another (likely bc I wouldn’t share vaxx status) mandated staff back to their office now 
1 year later- a bunch got COVID in the first two weeks.  

Yikes. 

whatevs! Freelancers go where the money is, while not returning to any office."
We had an Indian place around the corner for approximately 15 days but some scandale has occurred and “closed 2 weeks cause someone got COVID” became closed forever. Mystery malfeasance
quite frankly if my blood pee and covid don’t get me a deadline extension i dont know what will
Denial is a strong American trait. If we ignore it or don’t report it, it doesn’t exist and isn’t a problem. #massshooting #covid
Getting Covid the first day of pride is the most homophobic thing that the universe could pull on me rn
Feeling achy. Hope its not the flu, covid, monkey pox or D. All of the above
What are the odds that both principal &amp; understudy get sick during tech week? I reported to the team that I tested positive for covid. Then they posted a message that two cast members tested +. I noticed that my principal wasn't at rehearsal today and yes, he's the other + guy.
I’ve had covid for seven days and I’d really like to stay awake until the sun goes down. Maybe tomorrow.
Has anyone been hearing that the gov-provided orange box COVID tests are faulty? Frequent false negatives? 🥴
I had Covid last year for my bday i got make up for it &amp; I be 25🤕
I’m more frightened of getting shot than getting Covid.  @POTUS Executive Order NOW!
parem d ter covid
Anyone who’s interacted with me on social media in the past couple of days might want to get tested for Covid
We sure quit talking bout the COVID CORONAVIRUS suddenly, didn’t we?
This is the third Pride month since I came out in 2020 and the third I can’t safely attend because nobody cares about people who are high risk for COVID
Seething with anger right now at @RWalensky @CDCgov @POTUS Your political calculus re Covid is putting me at daily risk. I do not go to bars or eat inside at restaurants, but I work in an open office with 20 somethings who are in bars all weekend and bringing Covid to the office
How many years after the Covid scam will stores take down those stupid plastic barriers? 8? 10?
#DoFo @fordnation it's been 1,217 days or over 3 years since you got @HonDavidOnley report. Calls for strong new action on #accessibility for people w/ #disabilities. We need a real action plan. Your delays create more hardships during #COVID #AODA
guess who might have covid 😀
I would like to see the data on long covid stratified according to self-employed, small business, corporate and public sector.
The biggest thing I’ve been missing since Covid started is back and I’m LIVING
A4: Since 2016-2017, there's been something (new baby, new standards, COVID) that shook up the school year, so I'm excited that next year will be on where I can focus on refining and not building from scratch. #MCPchat
"Don’t know whether to blame age, the draining difficulty of the school year, or after-effects from covid, but this is the first time ever I haven’t had a perfect report card from my PCP after a checkup.

I’m still aware that I’m extremely lucky, but it’s weird to need follow-up."
This weird combination of lies, anarchy and christofascism the #CultRight is perpetrating on America is destabilizing the country far more than record inflation and covid.
eeee to com covid
Stuck in bed with Covid and I've run out of papers to write, so I'm pondering the important questions in life, like how much anxiety is the normal amount of anxiety?
Covid ruined my life
I just had a doctor tell me to Google stuff about Covid bc it changes daily. Mmmk
Trust me to get sick on the extra holiday (sticky sticks say I don’t have Covid &amp; neighbour’s kids are also down with a non-Covid bug)
"Why is anyone surprised that airlines are cancelling flights due to staff shortages?

Of course they are! 

Of course the staff got covid! 

Of course removing masks from airplanes during a pandemic is a horrible idea!

Disabled people have been saying this from the start."
happy pride month everyone i’ve been exposed to covid
Glad that I don’t have covid but also that just means that I’m just mystery sick… hate it here what is going onnn
"I continue to just be so disenfranchised with society, given that our answer to parents over two years into a pandemic is ""just send your unvaccinated babies to daycare despite the rising cases and the unknown long term effects of COVID as a virus."""
Mano fuck COVID #infected
Getting my positive Covid test result on the first day of Pride has got to be some form of biphobia, right?
Making a summer bucket list and a summer playlist so I feel less sad about having my first week of my summer being ruined by covid 😭😭
can’t smash with covid bahahHa
Who tf gets COVID 3 times like this shit is just wild AF yo
Pfizer $PFE just released a Covid-19 vaccine for kids aged 6 months to 4 years old, lining up its coffers with vax revenues $NVAX $JNJ $MRNA
Hey y’all I’m sorry Covid is kicking my butt today, I’ll try to stream tomorrow love y’all ❤️💛💙
I beat Covid's spiky pimple ass. And I'm with Johnny.
Remember the same party that didn't care people were dying of covid are the same people that don't care about mass shootings
Oh my god, do the COVID coughing fits ever stop?
"Covid ✔️

Depp vs Heard ✔️
NOW GET BACK TO WORK!!!"
"We must give people their jobs back who were sacked because of their COViD vaccination status. 

The mandates must end now. 

Too many industries are in crisis. 
Too many people have had their careers and livelihoods put on ice. 

We cannot let this continue."
i dont think canada could have fucked up their covid response any harder than they did and it still infuriates me to think about. we're STILL fucking it up.
Yes where all this evidence that not only did the police Commissioner used to mandate but all the employers of whom sack their workers for not getting vaccinated hmmm I see a lot court actions in the near future all I can say this serves you right going for the covid cash cow
Why i cldnt have covid and just b home fine? I need to be taking adv of this home time. But alas im bed stricken
Not even tryna be funny but it’s like bullets saw the amount of bodies that Covid claimed and got jealous.
"Four Horsemen of Apocalypse:
I see war with Russia &amp; Ukraine as well as others around the globe. I see pestilence &amp; death with Covid-19 &amp; other afflictions worldwide. Who seems others and in what?"
Covid was just one big game of hidden in plain sight
"I’m a Scorpio and I didn’t get COVID for two years.

So Astrology prevents COVID, but it only stops the spread entirely if everyone is a Scorpio."
Last week I had a slight fever which I informed my coach of since I can't come to work. So the clinic advised me to have my 7 days quarantined even though we're on covid alert level 1. And today would have my clearance and fit to work. 🙏
"Thought my chest had escaped this time. It was waiting for DAY4.

I’m upstate for a wedding and half of the guests can’t go because they have COVID but yeah go off don’t wear a mask at hannaford
I just don't know how you redeem a society so okay with so much death as long as few corporations make a profit. Mass shootings. Covid. Healthcare. This isn't sustainable. This isn't a status quo worth leaving fundamentally unchanged.
Not alot of my friends actually know that I was born, raised and educated in Canada. I accepted a position in the US after receiving a few offers. I have dual citizenships and the only thing missing is a clean covid test within 96 hours. In case you missed me 1/2
"Is there a non-COVID virus ripping through the Philly area right now?  Got sick last weekend and have been on my ass for 4 days now but tested neg for COVID twice in that span. Congestion, cough, fever, exhaustion. 

Whatever it is, it sucks."
Why is it that ever drug commercial list all the side effects but when you see a covid shot/ treatment pill they list no side effects? I think they are hiding the truth
So much for protecting ourselves from Covid …. Now we have to protect ourselves from shooters showing up at random places.
fuck me....i think i caught covid from my dad 💀
This marg ain’t tastin right 😞 shoutout Covid
i been so bored in the crib covid sucks
My daughters COVID negative. Back to school tomorrow they go!
While we cannot enforce testing, we advise anyone who was at MCM or CfZ to test for Covid before turning up to BristolFurs this weekend.
I need covid/surgery exhaustion to go tf away kthxbai
Why not treat high gas prices like COVID days, stop driving anywhere, stop buying it .... it will go down. #PROTESTGAS
Isolated in my house with COVID so I guess it’s as good of a time as any to watch The Batman.
Feeling like hammered hell. Home Covid test negative. Also went amd got another test we'll see. Hopefully this is just a bitch of a summer cold. Weird thing to hope for, I know.
Damn everyone got covid this weekend at them Memorial Day/graduation parties
The reason I never got Covid was because as a child my family let me play in the creek after they would eat chicken wings and I would collect the chicken bones thinking it was from a pack of wild chickens
"Pretty sure @pgcps still requires 100% mask wear. We’re at my daughter’s concert @BTMSTigers - teachers &amp; audience w/o masks &amp; no administrators/leadership present that I can see. Why have rules if no one enforces them?
#COVID #ThisIsWhyWeCantHaveNiceThings"
In another disappointing blow for COVID, COVID makes gin taste like yellow Triaminic. Was yellow Triaminic just a terrible gin reduction syrup all along?

Boys flat out, is Covid gone? How come nobody gets it anymore
My ass done tested positive for COVID for the 3rd damn time. I am sick of this shit 😒

With raging covid and lunatics shooting up schools, grocery stores and hospitals, there's never been a better time to be an agoraphobe. It seems crazy to LEAVE home at this point tbh.
Trump willingly let COVID-19 ravage the fucking planet and Biden couldn’t foresee the baby formula shortage so both sides!
The person in line in front of me at the pharmacy is here buying COVID tests. Coughing. Not wearing a mask. Ugh.
Srsly Covid fatigue hits different this shit sucks I can't even work like I used to I have to lay down every few hrs wtf
My brother-in-law is a Trump voter, a deer-huntin’ redneck, but we have some great debates sitting in the garage drinkin beer. He’s Christian but is cool w/ the gays; he even went to a couple gay bars with me and my sister &amp; had a blast. And he’s not a COVID conspirator either.
June first and I test positive for Covid, what a great start to pride month for me

Hospitals in our area have seen hundreds of patients for long-COVID in the past year. Latest CDC report shows 20% of adults have a health condition that could be from having COVID. Anyone experiencing long-lasting COVID symptoms that would want to do an interview with us tonight?

"it's crazy how many people quit working and bragged about abusing covid payments that are pissed they have to pay it back now...

but it's also crazy how canada forced it over EI, overpaid, told people they wouldnt have to pay it back, and are ruining lives to get it back now."
Now the freaks on Fox are trying to blame Marijuana for the cause of shootings. I think they need to drug test those people, forget the Covid test😝I remember the 60s and Woodstock and don’t remember Maraguana being a problem. All peace and love😝
i bet a woman wouldn't give me covid
You know what, my mum celebrates the jubilee. She’s English. I popped to see her as she’s got covid. I don’t hate everyone that’s into it. I don’t. Never will, pretty sure our kids won’t. But hate is not me. ❤️
tweeting at you live from the covid factory, the body aches just set in and i have to continue working for an hour and 15 mins. this sounds so dumb to say but i do not think i can do it i am actually miserable as fuck
Desantis allowed thousands in Florida to get infected with Covid and Abbott in Texas continues to support the selling of assault weapons dispite  multi mass shootings in that state to evil men .

People are dying in Ukraine. People are still dying of covid. People are dying of other diseases. And much of it was overshadowed the past few months by a trial between 2 rich celebrities hating each other. I don't get it 🤷‍♂️
"Leaving the EU didn’t give the UK greater freedom on vaccines or help to Ukraine.

The EU has achieved far more than the UK on Covid &amp; Ukraine. Sure, it’s much bigger. But also individual EU countries have achieved more relative to size.

The thing that kills me abour KE is when they say Covid changed everything lol like for who eve and villanelle they didn’t live in a time of Covid how the fuck I mean yes here in the time but not their story #killingeve what an excuse to use
I think if you are a Georgian and vote for hershell you are an idiot - walker’s murky-ass financial records, his body spray that promises to “kill the COVID,” he lied about graduating from U of GA, his doubt about human evolution, and most of all his history of Domestic Violence.

I have COVID. 0/10 do not recommend

First Covid kept us in the house now these mass shootings everyday it’s becoming a true pandemic of guns at this point
What is the scientific way to decide if *I* would benefit from a Covid booster given my personal health profile and (low) exposure? Titer test to measure immunity decay since previous booster? Do they even protect against current variants?

I have a ton of hand sewing piled up. I'm considering doing an 80s movie a night for a week to sew+embroider by. Desperately Seeking Susan, Lost Boys, and Less Than Zero? Surprisingly, not Vibes because I rewatched it way too many times during Covid lockdown, burned out on it.
You cant say a bad word about covid or stray from force fed opinions in the media or your account is removed while these thinspiration accounts are allowed and stay up.
Wonder how the @Cubs unvaxxed RF weathered Covid?

"I’m getting an experimental drug for COVID-vulnerable people &amp; the  warning sheet is so amusing. For allergies it says “don’t take drug X if you’re allergic to it.” for side effects it just lists all the side effects of an allergic reaction

"I can’t catch a break. I got better from Covid but now I’m sick with what the doctor believes is salmonella.

Long covid sucks and I've been so painful I had to call off work today but in better news, I passed my skill test and leveled up so I'll get a raise soon 😸
#MonkeypoxVirus hard for me to believe it's a coincidence that two separate diseases bat-origin covid and monkey origin monkey pox..both studied and apparently enhanced during those studies at biowarfare and 'for the science of it' labs suddenly break out one after the other
covid tests still make me feel like i’ve just realized my period is late
Not Covid being homophobic on June 1st to me…
Tested positive for COVID.  God's way of making me watch IEM Dallas.
If I won the lottery, I would found a bank on the principle that it’s okay to use the drive-thru ATM if you’re a pedestrian and there’s no other ATM. How in 2022 are you going to tell us the lobby is closed from COVID and we can’t walk through the drive-thru? We live in a society
bro this covid shit sucks so bad i want to eat desperately and haven’t been able to for like 2 days thankfully i’m vaxxed bc i feel like this would be so much worse
"When will everyone in power wake up and realize you need a multi level approach to solving country wide problems. It's so aggravating that every puts political blinders on to try to ""solve"" a problem. Was the same bullshit with covid."
Now that the Hollywood court case is over can we get back to the Covid scare some more, I mean I saw people out today talking and living life like it used to be.
when i go to set a timer it's already at either 15 minutes or 6.5 minutes because the only two things i time are covid tests and medium boiled eggs

"Disappointed to learn from first hand experience that @ORDeptEd and ""Ready Schools Safe Learners,"" along w/ @PPSConnect are NOT in compliance with @CDCgov recommendations for COVID-19 isolation. Learned from my son who got covid at school, and the response we've gotten fr school."
"Whooooboy!  Lots of Covid right now!  Be careful out there!!

If you’re not vaccinated, this is your sign. Covid just sent me to the hospital
Lots of people still getting COVID, it's in the never endemic phase
There's a flu bug going around and it's not covid 🤧🤧🤧
My weirdest covid symptom was being hella horny
Don't let Covid-19 bring you down! Instead, clean out your closet.
"Covid ""left"" and the white boys decided to shoot again"
In the last 48 hours, 8 people I know have gotten Covid. So if you’re feeling particularly free and flip, just know we are in the middle of a huge surge with no messaging to the public to protect themselves.
I had Covid over a month ago and i am still suffering from extreme and frequent brain fog and exhaustion AND I AM STILL FUCKING COUGHING. THE COUGH WILL NOT GO AND I AM TIRED.
#Uvalde #Ukraine #GlobalWarming #HumanRights #COVID #January6th to name a few, but sure #JohnnyDepp.
Legionaires and Covid have the same symptoms. So like huh?

Everyone catching covid right now
"Does Fauci alone have the authority to commit the government to purchase continuous Covid-19 vaccines? 

Now add the purchase of another unproven, Fauci advocated, vaccine for Monkeypox, with minimal therapeutic benefit."
Worked out for the first time since getting covid and barely made it halfway through a routine. Not sure if it was all the malaise these past 2 weeks or if I'm actually more fatigued but either way it sucks
i just woke up and jungwoo was tested positive for covid im gonna beat the shit out of this virus

MedTwitter question: How many of your offices are currently understaffed to severely understaffed because of workers out sick with COVID?
Social media peaked during covid lockdown. Unbeatable.
Got all the free Covid tests in the mail today. I now have 16 tests and I’ll probably give a bunch away because we don’t test
So now I gotta pray my wife gets fed. That she doesn’t catch Covid. That she can get off at 12 hours and not at 15. And not if she’s had active shooter training. Bc anybody who knows Jasmine knows she ain’t leaving her patients behind.
I swear if I got Covid for the second time…
I have a 2 hour kick off meeting with clients this afternoon (on teams) and I am so breathless from Covid idk how I’m gonna talk for 2 hours?! Need to catch my breath after a couple sentences lol

So today I tested positive for Covid… like wtf?! I never had Covid before even when it was at its highest peak so I’m confused
".@US_FDA There is No ""Emergency"" to shove Covid shots on our babies/healthy young children. COVID vaccine for ""emergency use"" in children Just Stop

Not that COVID testing isn’t free anymore 😂😂😂
Hire the nurses back who aren't vaxxed and BC wouldn't have to close some nessesary hospitals because of nurses calling in sick with covid.  None of the un-vaxxed are sick, how fucking stupid is the gov't
why do i feel guilty for having to make a minimum payment on my card even though i'm broke, have covid, and can't work? is it capitalism?
Positive for COVID 👍
Mrs C got her 4th vax shot while I have to wait another couple months because I caught the Covid and now she’s lording her invulnerability over me as she should.

#Covid9: Here we are in #Taiwan with nearly 90.000 cases a day and still strict quarantine rules to enter the country. It is like trying to stop a drop going to the ocean.  I wonder what we have learned after 2.5 years of Covid... Sad😢😭

"The most recent 7-day moving average is over 100,000 new covid cases a DAY.

Covid has been evil ok
I love that I was losing sleep over having Covid and it’s turned out to be less of a pain than a head cold
my mom might have covid 😦
at what point does the anger towards “officials” (?) from having long covid symptoms — which fully upend your daily life — leave your body? asking for me as I cannot take this any longer 🫠
Finally Covid negative 9 days after symptoms started 🙃

My luck finally ran out. Got the Covid at the convention. So did the friend I was sitting with. There was a coughing/sneezing dude right behind us. Day-umm!
What happened to plandemic? I don’t hear any talk about viruses anymore. Guess Covid and the variants disappeared
Only good thing to come out of COVID was it temporarily put a stop to all of the mass shootings in the country. But now that we’re back to normal, it’s becoming an everyday thing again

Good morning everyone 🌞I’m dropping off a care pack to a young family with Covid tonight - apart from Panadol, soup, fruit, tissues, juice, strepsils, vitamins, bone broth - anything else that would be helpful? Thanks
I thought I had recovered a lot from covid/flu but family visited today and suggested I look like I need another day recovering (they’ve been child minding.) Going back to bed
#TrudeauTheTyrant's top secret federal science exempts unvaccinated foreign nationals who transit through Canadian airports from any covid screening, while Canadian citizens are not even given the option to test as an alternative to vaccination to board the same aircraft.
Previously, I never looked forward to summer as I had to constantly worry about keeping my kids engaged. But this year, it’s a blessing! The last school year was the worst with 3 Covid waves &amp; ever changing protocols. I need a breather before the fun starts again in 2 months!
having covid is so fucking horrible. i just want to feel betterrrrrr ugh

If @POTUS doesn't have a single shred of care for the people in the #UnitedStates that he is going to kill over the simple cost of living. Then #WeThePeople should shut this country down for 2 weeks like covid did. Then #January6th would have looked like a flag football game.
"There are plenty of reasons not to like Joe Biden. The inflation isn't really one of them. Dem policies didn't do this, Covid did. And that should be stupidly obvious.

Well, here we go again. Placed another order with USPS for Covid tests on MAY 20. Rec'd confirmation but no shipping/tracking info yet. Nearly two weeks. You'd think by now this would be routine, but then these ARE the people who can't manage to keep my mail dry on wet days.
COVID sucks. I can't even enjoy dunking on bad takes or wrestling like a proper human without it hurting. call the army
Covid back popping again, everyone getting sick

During my covid illness I discovered the show Hacks. What a delightfully great show. Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder have such great chemistry. Worth the binge.
I am done hearing about Tory parties and how they should be fined. I'm not angry they had parties; I'm more concerned with why they weren't terrified to be around one another when they had all the data to show how dealt COVID is and why they had us all under house arrest.
Why tf are lateral flow test £15? Nvm, i don't need to know if i have covid i guess

Used Duolingo to work on my spanish
Watched @Scoop_Phase win some games.
IT WAS A GOOD DAY."
"thinking about how @catsmovie was the last thing I saw in a theater pre COVID...and all through pandemic, i thought ""I can end on this note...it was great and history will prove me right""

..however ""AVATAR II"" looks pretty dope

(history will still prove me right about CATS tho)"
If I was an employer I'd probably discriminate against people who graduate high school and college during COVID. If I was evil enough to own a business I would at least be hilarious about it.
Thought my nose job wiped out my phantosmia for good. Nope. It’s back. 24/7 cig smoke in my nostrils thats worse when I sit down or lay down. I can’t believe it came back. Fuck you COVID. I had the mildest case ever and now have to deal with this.
I have covid 🥺
Today in LA County there were 5 reported covid related deaths. Of those 5 reported 4 we're 80+ years old with underlying medical conditions. They  don't account for the remaining 1. And by the way, no reported cases of the Monkey Pox.
It’s June 1st and I tested positive for Covid 🤧😭
i ordered groceries bc i’m sick and can’t go to the store and they brought me parsley instead of cilantro and i’m really upset about it when in reality i won’t be able to taste it either way because covid is beating my ass  🤠
How is COVID in Seoul right now? Anyone there able to give me a sense? Where I am in San Francisco we are having a huge surge with many cases. :-(
"Change of subject:

@RTTNews 

My brother was supposed to fly in to see my mom and myself but had to cancel when he tested positive. Trip postponed

RE last tweet: if I watch your snap chat story within 1 min of you posting it… I apologize. Covid is doing it to me
Getting Covid first day of pride month feels extremely homophobic
First day of wearing mask again at work 🥲 .. it was good while it lasted .. but I’ll choose a mask over COVID any day 🤷🏽‍♀️
Covid got me again 😞
"This boy said he has been mandated to quarintine became he got COVID so he is going to do some gardening. 

WHY IS THIS NIGGA AT LOWES WITH NO MASK ON BUYING DIRT?!"
Facebook could have caught the Ramos Facebook postings and notified the police. It appears Facebook is more interested in COVID-19 and voting posts.
oh no maybe i shouldnt have taken an edible while i have covid???
I've felt more frustrated, grumpy, and generally bad disagreeable since I had Covid last month. Can't tell if it's related or just, you know, everything.
"Yeah, I'm totally late to the covid party.

Like every other party.

If work wasn't asking us to test for covid when calling in absence for 'feeling sick' my idiot would have gone to work and I'd have assumed I was having allergy &amp; circulation issues due to the weather change."
"Started hearing that legal stuff beginning of 2017 Ivanka. 

What storm Mr. Dimon? I owned three branches and you’re the spokesperson. I saw the scariness of looming towers.

That’s all the legal funk I’d ever have on my conscience."
BREAKING: Pfizer asks FDA to authorize its COVID-19 vaccine for children from six months to four years.  Haven't they killed enough of us yet?
Ima make chicken parm for dinner…I really still don’t feel good and the covid test saying I don’t got covid so what I got….stuck on stupid? 😂😂😂
There have been 3,493 new cases of COVID-19 in May.  As is usual, there are interruptions in reporting associate with the holiday weekend.
If you have Covid or have been around someone with it stay tf away from people, simple.
"I love my hairdresser. We always get right into the state of the world - fake news, media monopolies, Covid shellshock, 9-11, refugee hypocrisy, authoritarianism etc while she does my hair, and she says ""we just need to do a Guy Fawkes, burn it all down and start again."" ✂️✊️✂️"
Sun will make ya happy. So many been inside so much since Covid start. Got to get some sun.
Everyone’s covid experience is so different. I was achy and cold and had a sore throat for like 24 hours , then I had the worst nasal congestion of my life for like 3 days. Now I’m just a tad congested but that’s it
Not the message I wanted to send out, but I just tested positive for COVID. I was negative the last two days, but got some mild symptoms today. Luckily, I’m fully vaccinated &amp; am doing okay, but please continue to test! I wanted to let everyone who I was around last weekend know!
"My mother got Covid in her LTC in late March. When my brother could visit again in early May she asked for tylenol for headaches. That’s quite unusual for her.

I took her out on the balcony this week &amp; I thought she was having an aneurysm because she was in such pain.

Got covid, transferred to Pinch Ward and flooded my room whilst showering. I wasn't isolated enough anyway.
Grateful to @SPRORG for organizing a thoughtful conference around Covid safety - masks, vaccines, and lots of space to spread out.  So glad to be able to see colleagues and present my science after 3 years apart!
ted bundy needs to cool it with the covid. go ahead. cancel me.
Like dutty Adam Stewart who literally attempted to twist the government’s arm on covid using Twitter
"Does anybody know if there's a way to get my ""I got my Covid vaccine"" frame, Pride flag and Ukraine flag all together in my profile picture so I can support everything?"
"Non BTS related. I'm in my 6th week of 100 degree fever post covid. This shit needs to stop. 🥵🔥
Anyone have advice cuz the drs don't seem to have a clue?"
Not all my family going on a cruise and catching Covid..get me outta here lol
ever since covid hit shii life ain’t been the same, like what happened to them sam’s club samples?? 😭
"Mfs blame everything on covid ! 

Why yo house smell like that 
 THEM: covid 😒"
"Now that Covid isn’t the main headline looks like shooting is back on top

Evil world with an evil agenda 👁"
Is anyone else getting screwed by the federal government? When covid started &amp; our jobs went into stasis, the CRA site told us we qualified  and to apply for assistance! We did. Now the CRA say it sent us money we were not entitled to &amp; is going after both of us for $2,000 each!
So last week, my watch broke (my treat to myself a while ago, not even a year), my husband tested + for Covid, then everyone except the 4 yo tested positive. I stay home until Wednesday next week. Welp. At least I can work on a PowerPoint for work.
"Reported impact of COVID on 2 of my 50+ year old boosted relatives 4 weeks out. Not everyone has the same set of symptoms
*No refreshing sleep
*Cannot wake up in the morning
*1 week of intense pain top of head. Could not bear to be touched there
*Hearing loss in one ear- partial"
So incredibly proud of my brilliant friend @IzzieChapman for being awarded a well-deserved MBE 👑 in recognition of her services to the community during Covid- running @PWRtoConnect enabling over 1300 families to access remote schooling and working #QueensBirthdayHonours
bill gates talk say make i get covid vaccine i go carry 2 plus 1 booster shot. the guy no even try organize small something for boys wey loyal
Think I done caught Covid again
people be like “ummmmm covid didn’t go away you know!!!” like yeah and it never will same as the flu and the common cold and strep etcetcetc it will literally never go away so do your part and get vaccinated and stay away from people and live ur life bae
Covid restock hitting 😥 Stay safe beloved!
Just repeating myself, long covid is a problem and one that should be investigated, post viral symptoms are known to be a problem for some even before covid but research is hard, this pandemic gives a unique opportunity to learn more about post viral infection problems…. however
Anyone else just feel... stupider after COVID? Brain fog and fatigue are gone. I just feel less resilient when tackling work tasks.
i might have covid 😍😍😍
BC man among first Canadians to be approved for COVID-19 payout after contracting Guillain-Barre Syndrome within 30 days of receiving Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine. The man became partially paralyzed. So there seems to be some risk to some people.  #trudeaumustgo
Gripe, COVID ou sinusite?
DM me your email address and i’ll literally send you two free tix to kraftwerk ASAP. cant go to it with covid and all ofc
Last year due to covid….
If you're not wearing a mask anymore then covid is not an excuse for giving up using a keep cup. I reckon there are maybe two other people in my 50 story CBD building using them. #waronwaste
in case you’re not following my personal acct and you’re curious or care, a pal (me) has covid
Hearing all the stories about people getting covid after SWCA has got me re-thinking my attendance to SDCC 2022. I've heard that mask enforcement was not really a thing until the last day. Can @Comic_Con guarantee that mask enforcement will be 100% enforced this year?
Very big emergency sketch commission sale starting soon. Having covid has eventually fucked me over from last month and I'm going insane with how far behind I am and with how deep in financial issues I also am. I'll be posting details in a bit, as I'll be handling it differently.
I'm so grateful that I attended university prior to quarantine/covid. Despite going through changes every year, my sense of 'normalcy' was not disrupted and I needed that.
Arguably the only good thing to come out of covid is curbside pickup bc I really hate going in stores 🧍🏻‍♀️
"The @AP wrote this:
""@JoeBiden made some grandiose economic claims that gloss over one reason for historic growth - the U.S. population is far larger than in past decades. We added 6.4M jobs in 2021 but part of that was a rebound from 9.4M jobs lost during COVID in 2020!""
@RNC"
When you beat the Covid -19 allegations🙏🙏🙏
oomf’s positive covid &amp; she’s going to lorde tomorrow nwayz cs i said i dont mind yassss 😋
We tested positive today for covid. After going into quarantine and being super diligent with masks since March of 2020, I thought we were safe. I am so upset with the anti mask/ Vax man that intentionally coughed on my husband in line at the gas station.
tf 3 ppl from my team got covid at the same time. i know im not a healthy person but wow tyl i didn't get it
"COVID lockdowns and the #Ukraine war consequences on the economy will be unavoidable after summer.

What if Covid actually did end and I had to start coming up with excuses not to go out again.
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, except COVID-19
"Reminder: Hillary isn’t going to prison. There is no ObamaGate. No border wall. Beautiful healthcare didn’t arrive. North Korea still has nuclear weapons. His tax cut was for the rich. COVID didn’t go down to zero. There was no election fraud.

He is a criminal and a fraud."
Wait nvm guys the covid test was actually a pregnancy test
Just have allergies …. Not Covid
Fantastic news that Prof Paul Moss @ImmunologyUoB has  been awarded the OBE for services to COVID 19 research and immumotherapy in the Queens Jubilee honours. Congratations Paul.
I'm on a plane and another passenger is using his covid mask as an eye mask. Masks are not mandatory on the flight so...I guess...why not!! Lol
"Pfizer asked the FDA to authorize its 3 injections COVID vaccine for ""emergency use"" in children ages 6 months to 5 years old..but wasn’t  there a study saying the efficacy of the vaccine was only 12%?! And if you still think of the FDA as an independent body..do some research!!"
Sorry I haven’t posted much I’m home with covid
I’m so sorry about stalled commissions. Currently still in CA with Covid and can’t fly back until like the 6th. I’ll get working on art when I return, hopefully feeling better!!

COVID is not fun, but I do credit with not giving me bronchitis.  That was refreshing.
I don't think that it's fair that MY health outcomes rely on YOU not letting me get infected with Covid, or Influenza or the common cold.
Oh hey, yet another Covid-19 exposure warning for our kids from their school. I forget if this is #5 or #6 for the past 3 weeks.

Abortion rights being taken, consistent mass shootings, covid cases, silencing dv victims. This country is exhausting!
June 1 on F train, mask rate is 40%. Glad COVID has been eradicated. When’s the parade?
All these guys in NJPW with injuries or Covid sure doesn’t bode well for Forbidden Door.
it’s been confirmed. i have covid. 🙃
Lost all sense of taste and smell now. Which is fine because I’m not interested in food either. 🙄#Covid
Again. I have a question. If God will protect you from Covid 19 so you don't need the vaccine, then why do you have to load yourself with guns and Ammo just walk down the street 😉?
Destined to be a family of four who gets covid one at a time. About to start week two of isolation boooooooooooo.
"At least ten friends of mine (mostly here in STL) have tested positive for COVID in the last few days. It’s running rampant right now. Most are having mild symptoms, some symptoms are presenting as GI symptoms.

Stay safe, y’all!"
Biden has hurt America’s Armed Forces with policies like expelling members of the military who had exemptions to required Covid vaccines and instituting divisive CRT training. I insist on policies that support the U.S. military.
Well, I eventually found out tonight that my son in law caught #COVID on a visit to #Nashville, #Tennessee , #USA. at a Bachelor weekend trip for his best friend. Aye, to much whisky and way too much fun
When the COVID test and Peppa Pig lollipop (not pictured 🐷)!
im so nervous wtf 😭😭😭😭 i was a functional human being before covid,,, i rly hope nothing rly bad will happen to me,,,, hhhh orz
According to Alberta’s weekly Covid stats, Covid hospitalizations dropped 10.5% and Covid ICU admissions dropped 6.5% this week.  Those pushing mask and vaccine mandates have been totally discredited.
I'm not the biggest fan of student loan relief for numerous reasons but I do find it comical the amount of people who got some type of Covid funds complaining about government handouts
Y’all I know multiple people who have mildly symptomatic covid who tested negative when first showing symptoms and didn’t test positive until multiple days in. Make sure you’re testing multiple times if you have “just a cold or allergies.”
Looks like @RSNStats may be on the COVID-19 Related Injured List here, fans 😷
Hard to think of a more ridiculous inconsistency than COVID yolo America being one of the last countries to get rid of pre arrival test requirements.
Welp, caught covid :&lt; Test yesterday was negative, but is positive today. Oh wellllll
Minecraft Facts : no covid 19
I've got stuff to do tomorrow! I do think there's an historical issue though isn't there? The court system developing from the Royal Court and the Divine Right of Kings, and then this ... much like with covid vax ... expectation that all minority groups abide by it or b 'crazy'
I tested positive for covid again today so I’m having a drink about it. Registered my kids for daycare weeks ago and they can’t start until I test negative 🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃
Covid made so much time pass that some ah dem clothes i buy dey aint me no mo😂

I've been asked if there's any research on a covid infection causing a myeloma patient to relapse. Anyone heard anything on that? Another good reason to avoid covid if so, but I don't think I've heard anything on this. @KENNETHROMER @robweinkove @VincentRK @MerrimanEileen
i hate covid
If I had a dollar for every COVID test and drug test I took for school 🤑💸
bidens inflation is a lot more dangerous than covid ever was
whenever i remember how i was supposed to sing judy and the dream of horses by belle and sebastian at a talent show before covid it makes me CRY no one talk to me
Covid got me huffin and puffin a lil bit
I did call it when Covid first started… that was just a taste of what’s to come.
twice as many people have died of COVID in America than even the wildest estimates of famine in North Korea ‼️
Yesterday I tested positive for Covid. 😡 I was really hoping to avoid it forever. As there are only 8 days left of school, looks like yesterday was my last day. And yes, 98% of my school continues to wear masks even though we were told we don’t need to anymore.
YALL IM SEEING SVT THIS AUGUST 😭😭 missed out on seeing my ults in 2020 cuz covid, 2 years later i’m seeing my 2nd ults 🥹 feels like a reward
I have yet to hear someone say, I've tested positive for covid, symptoms are very severe, sure wish I would have got the vaccine. Compared to the I've tested positive mild symptoms thanks to my vaccine and boosters.  Actually, are the unvaccinated even getting covid?
Finally negative for covid
Y'all still paranoid bout COVID?!

Looking at FSU coordinators, dudes have actually been pretty good and have had a few really impressive seasons with every team they were with before coming to FSU . Idk if it was covid that slowed them down but we should really see a difference in 2022
Sooo. Covid.... I'm a bit overwhelmed by the management of the highschool fallout of this. Waiting on PCR results because despite negative RAT, husband had positive PCR. In general, school says kids with symptoms stay home, but also don't miss SAC or you will fail year 12.
reason #163527 why I hate living in my dorm: two dudes had covid and didn’t tell anyone so they just exposed everyone and didn’t isolate at all
Just happened to get 8 covid tests in the mail today. Just took the test. NEGATIVE. #phew
Just got a call from my son. His gf just tested positive for Covid. They were here last night, helping us pack things. Along with my daughter &amp; her 7 mo old baby, and my other son. 🤞🤞🤞 Hoping we are able to escape the worst. #COVIDisAirborne #CovidIsNotOver
